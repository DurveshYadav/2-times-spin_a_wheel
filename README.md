# SpinTheWheel

> [Click to see project](https://kiiirtiiii.github.io/SpinTheWheel/)

- User can spin the wheel by clicking on the "SPIN" button and then the wheel starts rotating with a sound in the background which gives a perfect illusion that the wheel is rotating and making the sound.
- After rotating randomly in the given time interval, wheel stops at the random position and user will get the random prize.
- The moment wheel stops, the pin starts an animation to show the winning prize and a confetti effect starts on the top of the screen which celebrates the prize of the user.
